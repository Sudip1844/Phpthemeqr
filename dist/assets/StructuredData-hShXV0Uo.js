There's no expiration date.",category:"Basics"},{question:"Can I edit or change a QR code after creating it?",answer:"Static QR codes cannot be edited after generation because the data is permanently encoded in the pattern. However, for URL QR codes, you can use a URL shortener that allows editing the destination, or regenerate a new QR code with updated information. Always test before printing.",category:"Editing"},{question:"What's the best size for printing QR codes?",answer:"For optimal scanning, QR codes should be at least 2 x 2 cm (0.8 x 0.8 inches) when printed.

However, more data makes the QR code more complex with smaller squares, which can be harder to scan. For best results, keep content concise - URLs, short text, contact info work best.",category:"Technical"},{question:"Do QR codes expire?",answer:"Static QR codes generated on our site never expire.

After the initial page load, My Qrcode Tool can work offline because it's a client-side application. Your browser caches the necessary files, allowing you to generate and customize QR codes without an internet connection. For scanning, camera access works offline too, though content like URLs will need internet to open.",category:"Technical"},{question:"Where is my QR code data stored?",answer:"Your QR code data is never stored anywhere except temporarily in your browser's memory while you're using the generator. When you download a QR code, it's created directly in your browser and saved to your device. We have no servers or databases, so your data is never uploaded, stored, or transmitted to us.",category:"Security"},{question:"How does the QR code scanner work?",answer:"Our QR scanner uses your device's camera or allows you to upload an image.
