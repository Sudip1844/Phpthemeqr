Consider rotating passwords periodically and using separate guest networks."},{question:"Do WiFi QR codes work with all devices and routers?",answer:"WiFi QR codes work with most modern smartphones (iOS 11+, Android 10+) and support WPA/WPA2/WPA3 encryption types.

There's no expiration date.",category:"Basics"},{question:"Can I edit or change a QR code after creating it?",answer:"Static QR codes cannot be edited after generation because the data is permanently encoded in the pattern. However, for URL QR codes, you can use a URL shortener that allows editing the destination, or regenerate a new QR code with updated information. Always test before printing.",category:"Editing"},{question:"What's the best size for printing QR codes?",answer:"For optimal scanning, QR codes should be at least 2 x 2 cm (0.8 x 0.8 inches) when printed.
