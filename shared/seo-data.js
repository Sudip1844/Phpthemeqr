It's especially effective for billboard ads, TV commercials, and print media where typing is inconvenient." },

However, once they send the initial message, you can respond and continue a two-way conversation normally. This makes SMS QR codes great for starting customer support conversations, collecting feedback, or enabling text-based services." }

Consider rotating passwords periodically and using separate guest networks." },

When scanned, the event opens in the user's default calendar app (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.) with all details pre-filled, ready to save." },
      { question: "Will calendar QR codes send automatic reminders to attendees?", answer: "The QR code itself doesn't send reminders, but once attendees save the event to their calendar, their calendar app's built-in notification system will handle reminders based on their personal settings. You can suggest reminder times in the event description (e.g., '1 hour before'), but the actual notifications are managed by each attendee's device." }

      { question: "How do image QR codes work?", answer: "Image QR codes contain a URL link to where your image is hosted online. When scanned, the QR code opens the image in the user's browser or photo viewer app. For best results, use reliable image hosting services or your own website. Note: QR codes don't embed the actual image data (that would be too large), they link to it." },
      { question: "Can I create a QR code with a logo or image inside it?", answer: "Yes! You can add a logo or small image to the center of any QR code for branding purposes. QR codes have error correction capabilities, so a logo covering up to 30% of the code still allows successful scanning. Many QR generators, including ours, support adding logos or custom images to make branded QR codes that align with your visual identity." }

You receive a notification once payment is complete." },
      { question: "Are there fees for receiving PayPal payments through QR codes?", answer: "PayPal's standard transaction fees apply to QR code payments, just like regular PayPal payments. For goods and services, fees are typically 2.99% + $0.49 per transaction in the US (rates vary by country). Friends and family payments within the same country are usually free.
